## Common Schema (for the Terraform Schema)

This directory contains placeholder classes representing [the `commonschema` types](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-azure-helpers/tree/main/resourcemanager/commonschema) when used in the Terraform Schema.

These empty classes are transformed as required in the Terraform Generator - and are merely placeholders.

This _is not_ used for Go SDK generation, which can be found in the `../CustomTypes` package.
