## Custom Types (`commonschema` for the Go SDK)

This directory contains placeholder classes representing [the `commonschema` types](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-azure-helpers/tree/main/resourcemanager/commonschema) when used in the Go SDK.

These empty classes are transformed as required in the Go SDK Generator - and are merely placeholders.

This _is not_ used for Terraform Schema generation, which can be found in the `../CommonSchema` package.
